### Strings
Strings can be declared by single or double quotes :
```
a = 'Hello'
b = "World"
```

Some characters can be escaped :
```
a = 'Hello\tworld.\nI\'m coding in Riddim !'
```

Here is the list of all escapes :

| Escape | Output |
| ------ | ------ |

| \\" | Double quote (") |
| \\\\ | Back slash (\\) |
| \\n | Line feed |
